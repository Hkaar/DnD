# Personal D&D Config

This is my personal configuration for my setup as a Dungeon Master.

## Programs

- Obsidian

## Setup Guide

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hkaar/DnD.git
```

Go to the directory

```bash
cd DnD
```

Rename the vault or copy the vault into your desired campaign name

```bash
mv obsidian-vault-template <campaign-name>
```

And then load it inside Obsidian! :3
